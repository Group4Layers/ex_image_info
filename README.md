## Description

Main module that checks and gets if a binary seems to be an image (specific
format), the mime-type (and variant detected) and the dimensions of the image
(based on the type).

It has convention functions to guess the type of an image by trying the formats
supported by the library.

### Main features

- Check the validity of binary by providing a specific image format*.
- Guess the validity of an image*.
- Get the mime-type and variant type by providing a specific format.
- Guess the mime-type and variant type of an image.
- Get the dimensions of an image by providing a specific format.
- Guess the dimensions of an image.

*Note: both cases as a general overview (partially checked).

### Formats

Supported formats (image type to be parsed as):
- `:bmp`
- `:gif`
- `:ico` (new in `v0.2.0`)
- `:jpeg`
- `:jpg` (alias of `jpeg` in `v0.2.3`)
- `:jp2` (new in `v0.2.0`)
- `:png`
- `:pnm` (new in `v0.2.0`)
- `:psd`
- `:tiff`
- `:webp` (VP8X animated in `v0.2.4`)

## Mime-types and Variants

The image variant type is an invented string to identify the
type of format recognized by this library (more specific than the
mime-type).

Each mime-type can be linked to at least one variant type:

| mime-type                 | variant type | description        |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `image/bmp`               | `BMP`        |                    |
| `image/gif`               | `GIF87a`     | 87a gif spec       |
| `image/gif`               | `GIF89a`     | 89a gif spec       |
| `image/x-icon`            | `ICO`        |                    |
| `image/jpeg`              | `baseJPEG`   | baseline JPEG      |
| `image/jpeg`              | `progJPEG`   | progressive JPEG   |
| `image/jp2`               | `JP2`        | JPEG2000           |
| `image/png`               | `PNG`        |                    |
| `image/x-portable-anymap` | `PNMpbm`     | Portable BitMap    |
| `image/x-portable-anymap` | `PNMpgm`     | Portable GrayMap   |
| `image/x-portable-anymap` | `PNMppm`     | Portable PixMap    |
| `image/psd`               | `PSD`        |                    |
| `image/tiff`              | `TIFFII`     | II variant         |
| `image/tiff`              | `TIFFMM`     | MM variant         |
| `image/webp`              | `webpVP8`    | lossy              |
| `image/webp`              | `webpVP8L`   | lossless           |
| `image/webp`              | `webpVP8X`   | animated           |

The variant type is created just to provide a bit more of information
for every image format (if applicable).

*Note*: `:ico` returns the dimensions of the largest image contained (not the first found).

The guessing functions try to detect the format of the binary by testing every available type based on its global usage (popularity, [usage of image file formats](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/image_format/all), but still keeping the `:png` as the first one):
- `:png`, `:jpeg`, `:gif`, `:bmp`, `:ico`, `:tiff`, `:webp`, `:psd`, `:jp2`, `:pnm`

**Warnings:**

- Use with caution the formats *ico*, *jp2* and the family *pnm*. They are implemented without following other libraries (just reading the specs - sometimes working with old drafts like *jp2*). You can support this library by providing more tests and image *fixtures* or requesting other variants to be tested.

## Installation

Add `ex_image_info` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`.

From Hex:

```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      # ...
      {:ex_image_info, "~> 0.2.4"},
    ]
  end
```

Or GitHub:

```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      # ...
      {:ex_image_info, github: "Group4Layers/ex_image_info"},
    ]
  end
```

Then, use it:

```elixir
require ExImageInfo
# ExImageInfo.seems? ...
```

## Examples

The following examples are run with the latest version of the library under the next environment:

```elixir
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.0.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (1.3.2) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```

### Feature `seems?`

`89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` are the first 8 bytes in the `PNG` signature (`PNG\\r\\n0x1A\\n`).

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.seems? <<0x89504E470D0A1A0A::size(64)>>, :png
true

iex(2)> ExImageInfo.seems? <<0x89504E470D0A1A0A::size(64)>>, :webp
false
```

`ExImageInfo.seems?/2` and `ExImageInfo.seems?/1` does not necessarily needs a real image (as it is shown in the previous example) because it just checks the signature of every file format.

Usually it is used as:

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.seems? File.read!("path/to/image.gif"), :gif
true

iex(2)> maybe_png_binary |> ExImageInfo.seems? :png
false
```

`38 42 50 53` are the first 4 bytes in the `PSD` signature (`8BPS`).

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.seems? <<0x38425053::size(32)>>
:psd

iex(2)> ExImageInfo.seems? <<0x384250::size(24)>>
nil
```

`ExImageInfo.seems?/2` and `ExImageInfo.seems?/1` does not necessarily needs a real image (as it is shown in the previous example) because it just checks the signature of every file format.

Usually it is used as:

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.seems? File.read!("path/to/image.unknown")
:tiff

iex(2)> webp_full_binary |> ExImageInfo.seems?
:webp
```

### Feature `type`

`89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` are the first 8 bytes in the `PNG` signature (`PNG\\r\\n0x1A\\n`).

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.type <<0x89504E470D0A1A0A::size(64)>>, :png
nil

iex(2)> ExImageInfo.type <<"RIFF", 0::size(32), "WEBPVP8L", 0::size(32), 0x2F7AC07100358683B68D::size(80)>>, :webp
{"image/webp", "webpVP8L"}
```

The signature part of a png it is now enough to get the type (it check also the IHDR field, just before the width and height).

Usually it is used as:

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.type File.read!("path/to/image.gif"), :gif
{"image/gif", "GIF87a"}

iex(2)> maybe_png_binary |> ExImageInfo.type :png
nil
```

The *guessed* version.

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.type <<0x38425053::size(32)>>
{"image/psd", "PSD"}

iex(2)> ExImageInfo.type <<0x384250::size(24)>>
nil
```

Usually it is used as:

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.type File.read!("path/to/image.unknown")
{"image/tiff", "TIFFMM"}

iex(2)> webp_full_binary |> ExImageInfo.type
{"image/webp", "webpVP8"}
```

### Feature `info`

`89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` are the first 8 bytes in the `PNG` signature (`PNG\\r\\n0x1A\\n`).

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.info <<0x89504E470D0A1A0A::size(64)>>, :png
nil

iex(2)> ExImageInfo.info <<"RIFF", 0::size(32), "WEBPVP8L", 0::size(32), 0x2F7AC07100358683B68D::size(80)>>, :webp
{"image/webp", 123, 456, "webpVP8L"}
```

The signature part of a png it is now enough to get the type (it check also the IHDR field, just before the width and height).

Usually it is used as:

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.info File.read!("path/to/image.gif"), :gif
{"image/gif", 1920, 1080, "GIF87a"}

iex(2)> maybe_png_binary |> ExImageInfo.info :png
nil
```

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.info <<0x38425053::size(32)>>
nil

iex(2)> ExImageInfo.info <<0x38425053::size(32), 0::size(80), 10::size(32), 12::size(32)>>
{"image/psd", 12, 10, "PSD"}
```

Usually it is used as:

```elixir
iex(1)> ExImageInfo.info File.read!("path/to/image.unknown")
{"image/tiff", 128, 256, "TIFFMM"}

iex(2)> webp_full_binary |> ExImageInfo.info
{"image/webp", 20, 100, "webpVP8"}
```

## Benchmarks

Group4Layers developed the fastest elixir library to obtain the dimensions of the images (binary data parsed). Also, it excels supporting the maximum number of image formats. All without dependencies.

![ExImageInfo Benchmarks](assets/ex_image_info_benchmarks.png)

(The image wouldn't be included in the package).

## Design decisions

### Why `seems?` and not `magic?` or `signature?`?

Because for some formats it is enough with the [*magic
number*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)) or the
signature to get the type (image format that "starts" correctly), but in other
cases it is an algorithm a bit more complex to see if the binary seems
correct. Therefore, *seems* it is more general (than getting the *magic
number*) and it will provide a "quick overview" of the validity of the
binary.

### Why returning the mime-type and variant type when getting the dimensions (`info`)?

Because both types (variant if applicable) are necessary to obtain the width and height
of the binary for a specific format. In case it is required both the type (and variant) and the dimensions it is not necessary to call two functions (and re-parse part or completely the binary). Therefore, to get the dimensions it is obtained the types and all the information is returned in one step.

### Renamed from ExImageSize to ExImageInfo

Although it has been released since the very first version with the name ExImageInfo,
this library was previously known as ExImageSize, but it is preferable to have a name
less restricted. Nowadays it can get information about the type and the dimensions (size),
but in a future it could increase the amount of info to extract from an image.

This idea comes from libraries that I have used in other platforms and/or languages. Algorithms and some concepts are picked and based on parts of the following:
- image-size (JavaScript) - *Aditya Yadav*
- imagesize (Ruby) - *Keisuke Minami*
- fastimage (Ruby) - *Stephen Sykes*
